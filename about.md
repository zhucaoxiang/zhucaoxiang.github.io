## About me
Hi, I am Caoxiang ZHU. My Chinese name is 祝曹祥. You can call me Caoxiang (*／tsáo ʃʌŋ／*).
I work at the **Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory** ([PPPL](www.pppl.gov)) as a Stellarator Optimization Scientist (potsdoc position).

My main research interest focuses on the [**FOCUS**](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/FOCUS/).
The FOCUS code is designed to find the most optimized coils for [stellarators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator).
I has been developing the FOCUS code for the past two years.
Besides the coil design, I'm also intereted in stellarator optimizations and I have also done some work in coil engineering analysis.
You can view my CV or look at my research page for more information.
